                    ZENKIT UI COMPONENTS - ISSUES FOUND
================================================================================

Project: CodeLab
Date: January 2026

================================================================================
COMPONENTS THAT DID NOT WORK
================================================================================

1. AppShell (AppShell, AppShellHeader, AppShellNavbar, AppShellMain)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ISSUE: Layout completely broken - header, sidebar, and main content
          all overlap each other instead of being in proper positions.

   WORKAROUND: Replaced with custom flexbox layout using native HTML
              elements (header, aside, main) with inline CSS styles.


2. Sidebar (Sidebar, SidebarHeader, SidebarContent, SidebarGroup, SidebarItem)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ISSUE: Part of broken AppShell layout. Sidebar items were cut off on
          the left side, icons partially hidden, and text from main
          content was bleeding through the sidebar.

   WORKAROUND: Replaced with custom buttons and divs with explicit
              inline styles and colors.


3. Modal
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ISSUE: Modal was not clickable at all. Could not type in input fields,
          could not click template cards, could not click buttons.
          Appears to be a z-index issue where the modal backdrop or
          some overlay was blocking all pointer events.

   WORKAROUND: Replaced with custom modal implementation using:
              - Fixed positioning (position: fixed, top/left/right/bottom: 0)
              - High z-index (z-index: 9999)
              - Native HTML inputs and buttons
              - onClick stopPropagation to prevent closing when clicking inside


4. Grid
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ISSUE: Grid columns not rendering properly. Layout was broken and
          items were not aligning in the expected grid format.

   WORKAROUND: Replaced with native CSS grid using inline styles:
              display: 'grid'
              gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(2, 1fr)' or 'repeat(3, 280px)'


5. Splitter (Splitter, SplitterPanel)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ISSUE: Splitter layout completely broken in Editor page. Panels were
          not sizing correctly, content was cut off, and the three-panel
          layout (file explorer, editor, preview) was not rendering properly.

   WORKAROUND: Replaced with CSS flexbox layout using fixed widths and
              flex: 1 for the code editor panel.


6. ContextMenu
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ISSUE: Not tested thoroughly but removed along with other broken components.

   WORKAROUND: Removed context menu functionality for now. Can add back
              using native right-click events if needed.


================================================================================
COMPONENTS THAT WORKED FINE
================================================================================

- Button (all variants: solid, outline, ghost)
- Card (outlined, filled variants)
- Text
- Stack
- Group
- Badge
- Input
- Alert
- Avatar
- Empty
- Skeleton
- FormItem

- Divider


================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Fix AppShell component - check CSS positioning and z-index
2. Fix Modal component - ensure modal content has higher z-index than backdrop
3. Fix Grid component - verify CSS grid implementation
4. Add proper testing for layout components before publishing
